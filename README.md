# Gesture-Based-Volume-Control
This project aims to create a gesture-controlled volume system using Open CV and Mediapipe, allowing users to control the volume of their device with hand gestures. The system uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect and track hand movements, enabling a hands-free and intuitive way to control volume.
